Throughout human history, our society has relied on various forms of payments to facilitate trade and exchange - from humble bartering to the sophistication of primitive currencies, coins, and paper money. As the 20th century unfolded, the advent of banking systems and checks added efficiency and structure to financial dealings, while credit cards, electronic payments, and online banking revolutionized our transactional landscape, bringing newfound convenience into our lives.

However, the rise of centralized payment systems also brought concerns over privacy, security, and control, creating the need for a decentralized alternative that could empower individuals in the realm of finance.

In response to these concerns, an innovation was born from the core principle of decentralization - cryptocurrencies emerged, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, offering secure, transparent, and peer-to-peer transactions, untethered from traditional financial institutions.

But as the world of Web2 progressed, payment gateways and point-of-sale transactions became seamless and prevalent, thanks to pull payments or payment requests. However, with the advent of Web3 and blockchain technology, the payment landscape has been plagued by various challenges, deterring mainstream adoption. Complex wallet addresses, varying from one blockchain to another, have hindered the seamless transfer of assets and led to user confusion. Additionally, cross-chain transactions have been difficult, risky, and required users to navigate unfamiliar processes.

To address these challenges, there was a growing need for user-friendly solutions that streamline Web3 transactions and with this idea fetch was born.
