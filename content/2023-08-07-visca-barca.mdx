Flashbots is a research and development organization formed to mitigate the negative externalities and existential risks posed by miner-extractable value (MEV) to smart-contract blockchains. We propose a permissionless, transparent, and fair ecosystem for MEV extraction to reinforce the Ethereum ideals.

In this article, we cover the context and motivation for this project. Technical details of our proposed solution can be found on the [ETHResearch forum](https://ethresear.ch/t/flashbots-frontrunning-the-mev-crisis/8251).

## What is MEV
Miner extractable value (MEV) is a measure devised to study consensus security by modeling the profit a miner (or validator, sequencer, or other privileged protocol actor) can make through their ability to arbitrarily include, exclude, or re-order transactions from the blocks they produce. MEV includes both ‘conventional’ profits from transaction fees and block rewards, and ‘unconventional’ profits from transaction reordering, transaction insertion, and transaction censorship within the block a miner is producing.

The term MEV can be misleading as one would assume it is miners who are extracting this value. In reality, the MEV present on Ethereum today is predominantly captured by DeFi traders through structural arbitrage trading strategies; miners indirectly profit from these traders’ transaction fees. One example of such structural arbitrage opportunities are Uniswap price arbitrage trades: when a Uniswap pool’s assets become mispriced, a profit opportunity is created to arbitrage the Uniswap pool back to parity with other trading venues. Of course, rather than letting the trader pay them a transaction fee for the privilege of collecting the arb profit, a miner could simply decide to run this strategy themselves.

## The MEV Crisis
Transactors on Ethereum express their willingness to pay for inclusion in a block through their transaction’s gas price, and therefore through the transaction fee they indicate they are willing to pay miners. Miners, as economically rational actors, pick the transactions with the highest gas price and order them by gas spend in the block they are producing. The financial system being built on Ethereum creates many ‘pure’ profit opportunities such as liquidations and arbitrages of many kinds. However, these opportunities are finite and episodic, and as such, traders compete to claim them. Right now, this competition is primarily expressed either via frontrunning, or via backrunning:

* Frontrunning (also known as Priority Gas Auctions (PGAs)): Transaction A is broadcasted with a higher gas price than an already pending transaction B so that A gets mined before B.
(eg. to snatch a Uniswap price arbitrage trade to rebalance a pool).

* Backrunning: Transaction A is broadcasted with a slightly lower gas price than already pending transaction B so that A gets mined right after B in the same block.
(eg. to execute a DyDx liquidation after a price oracle update that triggers a DyDx loan to go under the required collateralization ratio).

Unfortunately, both frontrunning and backrunning are inefficient and lead to negative externalities such as network congestion (i.e. p2p network load) and chain congestion (i.e. blockspace usage). In addition, this competition for MEV opportunities leads to Ethereum consensus security instability due to the creation of incentives for time-bandit attacks and permissioned communication infrastructure between traders and miners. Such an infrastructure erodes the neutrality, transparency, decentralization, and permissionlessness of Ethereum today.

While none of these existential risks and negative externalities are new, we find ourselves at a critical junction between alternative futures for Ethereum. A series of events in the past 6 months have lead usage of the network to reach a tipping point:

* **Steadily increasing contract interactions** (ie. there are more complex transactions on Ethereum than before which increases the absolute amount of MEV up for grabs.)

* **Token market cap exceeding ETH market cap** (ie. MEV revenue in ERC-20 tokens is starting to compete with regular transaction fees paid in ETH.)

* **Transaction fees exceeding block rewards** (ie. transaction fees have reached unprecedented levels partly due to traders pushing the gas prices up when competing for trading opportunities. It is a clue that MEV-related revenue may surpass block reward for miners.)

* **Adoption of generalized frontrunners** (ie. an indicator of increased sophistication in MEV extraction.)

* **Adoption of permissioned mempools** (ie. another indicator of such sophistication)

These events indicate an accelerating trend towards the foretold existential risks and negative externalities.

## Frontrunning the MEV crisis

_Enter Flashbots_

Flashbots is a research and development organization formed to mitigate the negative externalities and existential risks posed by MEV to smart-contract blockchains. We propose a permissionless, transparent, and fair ecosystem for MEV extraction to preserve the ideals of Ethereum.

Our approach to mitigating the MEV crisis can be broken down into three parts: Illuminate the Dark Forest, Democratize Extraction, and Distribute Benefits. We believe each part is necessary for Flashbots to succeed.

### Illuminate the Dark Forest
MEV is currently opaque to users of Ethereum. It requires significant data analysis and in-depth knowledge of smart contracts to understand as it involves transactions with complex, sometimes obfuscated, logic and adversarial games played on several meta-levels (users, traders, generalized frontrunners, miners).

As more and more security-critical infrastructure moves off-chain, and as chain state and size grows, this problem will only get worse and it will become increasingly difficult to leverage one of the original promises of cryptocurrency: transparency. By Illuminating the Dark Forest, we aim to preserve this original promise. More practically, we aim to allow for the objective assessment of the negative externalities of the MEV crisis and the impact of Flashbots technologies, and for the quantification of user harm caused by MEV extraction in order to provide tooling for builders to reduce their dApp’s surface for MEV extraction.

Our first step to Illuminate the Dark Forest is quantifying its impact. We’ve built MEV-Inspect for this purpose. It scans Ethereum blocks and enables visualization of MEV metrics over time. We use it to better understand the MEV ecosystem and provide it to the community in an attempt to annihilate information asymmetry.
